# Fetchingdata
To fetch data from one file to another in Node.js, you can use the require function to import data or functions from one file (module) into another. 

 ## Assuming you have two files:

  1.Source File (source.js): This is the file from which you want to export data or functions.

  2.Destination File (destination.js): This is the file where you want to import and use the data or functions from the source file.
